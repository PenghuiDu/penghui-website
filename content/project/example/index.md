**Research question:** To what extent do neural networks resemble the human brain's fMRI representation when visual stimuli are input? This project aims to compare a large number of neural networks with fMRI signals with Partial Least Squares (PLS) and establish a benchmark based on fMRI that measures the similarity of machine learning models to brain representations.

The study is currently underway and is scheduled to be completed by June 2024
