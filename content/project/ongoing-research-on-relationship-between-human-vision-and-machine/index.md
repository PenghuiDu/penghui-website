summary: To what extent do neural networks resemble the human brain's
  representation when visual stimuli are input? This project aims to compare the
  representation of neural networks with human fMRI signals by Partial Least
  Squares (PLS) and establish a benchmark. We hope to discover something
  interesting by analysing the similarity of a large number of neural networks
  to the brain.

**Research question:** To what extent do neural networks resemble the human brain's representation when visual stimuli are input? This project aims to compare the representation of neural networks with human fMRI signals by Partial Least Squares (PLS) and establish a benchmark. We hope to discover something interesting by analysing the similarity of a large number of neural networks to the brain.

The study is currently underway and will be completed by June 2024
