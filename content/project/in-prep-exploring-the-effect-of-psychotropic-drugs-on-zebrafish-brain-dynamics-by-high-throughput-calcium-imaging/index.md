title: In Prep | Exploring the effect of psychotropic drugs on zebrafish brain
  dynamics by high-throughput calcium imaging

summary: In this research project, we employed a novel high-throughput screening
  system to collect a vast amount of neural activity data (via calcium imaging)
  from zebrafish exposed to psychotropic drugs. Subsequently, we analyzed the
  data to explore the influence of psychotropic drugs on the activity across
  various brain regions, as well as the functional connectivity within the
  zebrafish's brain.
