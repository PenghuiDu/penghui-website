title: In Prep | Exploring the effect of psychotropic drugs on zebrafish brain
  dynamics by high-throughput calcium imaging
date: 2022-09-30T19:12:26.021Z
summary: >-
  In this research project, we employed a novel high-throughput screening system
  to collect a vast amount of neural activity data (via calcium imaging) from
  zebrafish under neuropharmacological conditions. Subsequently, we analyzed the
  data to explore the influence of psychotropic drugs on the activity across
  various brain regions, as well as the functional connectivity within the
  zebrafish's brain.


  This project is ongoing and will be finished by the end of 2023.
