In this research project, we employed a novel high-throughput screening system to collect a vast amount of neural activity data (via calcium imaging) from zebrafish exposed to psychotropic drugs. Subsequently, we analyzed the data to explore the influence of psychotropic drugs on the activity across various brain regions, as well as the functional connectivity within the zebrafish's brain.
