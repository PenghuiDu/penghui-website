title: "In Prep |  Human Brain Boundary Mapping based on PET-MRI: A Comparative Study"
date: 2023-08-05T20:10:24.884Z
summary: In this project, we plan to use PET-MRI data to detect boundaries
  signifying abrupt change in metabolism rate and functional connectivity. Then
  we will compare the boundary morphologies derived from these two modalities,
  and quantify how well they align with each other. We also plan to compare the
  results with other parcellation criteria such as cytoarchitecture and
  anatomical landmarks.
