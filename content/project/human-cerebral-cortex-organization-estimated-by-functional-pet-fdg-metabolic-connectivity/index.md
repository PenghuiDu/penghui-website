title: "[OHBM 2024] Human Cerebral Cortex Organization Estimated by Functional
  PET-FDG Metabolic Connectivity"
date: 2023-12-08T20:10:24.884Z
summary: The recent development of high-temporal resolution functional PET
  (fPET) introduces an emerging focus on "metabolic connectivity (MC)" ,
  providing a complementary perspective to the hemodynamic-based "functional
  connectivity (FC)" assessed by fMRI. In this study, we applied a connectivity 
  based analytical scheme on a resting-state fPET-fMRI dataset, aiming to 
  characterize the cortical organization of glucose metabolic dynamics and 
  understand how it differs from the hemodynamics based functional network structures.

  caption: Functional connectivity (FC) derived from BOLD-fMRI has provided
    significant insights into human brain organization. The recent introduction
    of constant-infusion functional [18F]PET (fPET)-FDG has enabled us to track
    dynamic changes in glucose metabolism over time, sparking growing interest
    in 'metabolic connectivity' (MC)â€”the temporal synchrony of FDG-based
    metabolic dynamics between distant brain regions. In this study, we employed
    a connectivity gradient-based analysis scheme on a resting-state
    simultaneous fPET-fMRI dataset, aiming to characterize the detailed cortical
    organization of fPET-derived MC and understand its differences from
    fMRI-derived network structures
