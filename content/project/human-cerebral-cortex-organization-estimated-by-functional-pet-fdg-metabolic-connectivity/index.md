title: Human Cerebral Cortex Organization Estimated by Functional PET-FDG
  Metabolic Connectivity [OHBM 2024]
date: 2023-12-08T20:10:24.884Z
summary: The recent development of high-temporal resolution functional PET
  (fPET) introduces an emerging focus on "metabolic connectivity (MC)" ,
  providing a complementary perspective to the hemodynamic-based "functional
  connectivity (FC)" assessed by fMRI. In this study, we applied a connectivity
  gradient-based analytical scheme on a resting-state simultaneous fPET-fMRI
  dataset, aiming to characterize the detailed cortical organization of
  fPET-derived MC and understand how it differs from the fMRI-derived functional
  network structures.
