I am a junior at the Southern University of Science and Technology, majoring in Intelligent Medical Engineering, and currently studying as a visiting student at the University of Zurich. My academic interests encompass neuroscience, machine learning, and cognition, with a specific focus on fMRI data analysis. I am highly motivated to pursue a PhD in this field and conduct research to advance our understanding of the human brain.
