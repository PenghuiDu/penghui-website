Hi! I'm Penghui, currently pursuing a Master's degree in the Neuro-X program at EPFL. My research interests focus on neuroimaging data analysis and neuromodulation techniques. I plan to pursue a PhD and am passionate about translating insights from neuroimaging to benefit clinical practice and disease research.
