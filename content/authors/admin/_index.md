ü•≥Aloha! My name is Penghui Du, I am doing my master in Neuro-X at EPFL. 

I love coding, and I believe our brains also function according to an intricate, yet elegant, 'code' that enables our incredible cognitive abilities. Propelled by this notion, I am eager to delve into the field of neuroscience, aiming to uncover the underpinning 'code' that explains our mind and behaviour, and provide new insights into the treatment of neurological disorders.

Outside of my academic interests, I enjoy cooking, jogging, and travelling.
