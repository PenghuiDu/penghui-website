abstract: "Transfer learning improves the performance of the target task by
  leveraging the data of a specific source task: the closer the relationship
  between the source and the target tasks, the greater the performance
  improvement by transfer learning. In neuroscience, the relationship between
  cognitive tasks is usually represented by similarity of activated brain
  regions or neural representation. However, no study has linked transfer
  learning and neuroscience to reveal the relationship between cognitive tasks.
  In this study, we propose a transfer learning framework to reflect the
  relationship between cognitive tasks, and compare the task relations reflected
  by transfer learning and by the overlaps of brain regions (e.g., neurosynth).
  Our results of transfer learning create cognitive taskonomy to reflect the
  relationship between cognitive tasks which is well in line with the task
  relations derived from neurosynth. Transfer learning performs better in task
  decoding with fMRI data if the source and target cognitive tasks activate
  similar brain regions. Our study uncovers the relationship of multiple
  cognitive tasks and provides guidance for source task selection in transfer
  learning for neural decoding based on small-sample data."
