abstract: Infusing cognitive science into model evaluation can guide the
  evolution of large models and improve model safety in human society; in turn,
  large language models as an emerging research subject of cognitive science
  offer test beds to examine and manipulate the evolution of multidimensional
  intelligence. Interdisciplinary collaborations are necessary to break down
  barriers between academia and industry to jointly provide task sets, datasets,
  and model sets
