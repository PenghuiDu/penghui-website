abstract: >-
  Infusing cognitive science into model evaluation can guide the evolution of
  large models and improve model safety in human society; in turn, large
  language models as an emerging research subject of cognitive science offer
  test beds while emulating human-like judgments and enabling efficient
  cognitive tests. Interdisciplinary collaborations are necessary to break down
  barriers between academia and industry to jointly provide task sets, datasets,
  and model sets.
