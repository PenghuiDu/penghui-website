abstract: During the evolution of large models, performance evaluation is
  necessarily performed on the intermediate models to assess their capabilities,
  and on the well-trained model to ensure safety before practical application.
  However, current model evaluations mainly rely on specific tasks and datasets,
  lacking a united framework for assessing the multidimensional intelligence of
  large models. In this perspective, we advocate for a comprehensive framework
  of artificial general intelligence (AGI) test, aimed at fulfilling the testing
  needs of large language models and multi-modal large models with enhanced
  capabilities. The AGI test framework bridges cognitive science and natural
  language processing to encompass the full spectrum of intelligence facets,
  including crystallized intelligence, a reflection of amassed knowledge and
  experience; fluid intelligence, characterized by problem-solving and adaptive
  reasoning; social intelligence, signifying comprehension and adaptation within
  multifaceted social scenarios; and embodied intelligence, denoting the ability
  to interact with its physical environment. To assess the multidimensional
  intelligence of large models, the AGI test consists of a battery of
  well-designed cognitive tests adopted from human intelligence tests, and then
  naturally encapsulates into an immersive virtual community. We propose that
  the complexity of AGI testing tasks should increase commensurate with the
  advancements in large models. We underscore the necessity for the
  interpretation of test results to avoid false negatives and false positives.
  We believe that cognitive science-inspired AGI tests will effectively guide
  the targeted improvement of large models in specific dimensions of
  intelligence and accelerate the integration of large models into human
  society.
